## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Flow Explanation üöÄ**

1. **Authentication**

    - User logs in using **Google OAuth**.
    - The system retrieves or creates a user in the `users` table.

2. **Booking Appointments**

    - A **patient selects a doctor** and **chooses a time slot**.
    - An entry is created in `appointments` with `status = "pending"`.

3. **Managing Medical Records**

    - Doctors can **update patient medical records** in `medical_records`.
    - A patient's **vital signs history** is tracked in `vitals`.

4. **Billing Process**

    - Once an **appointment is completed**, a **billing entry is created**.
    - The patient or their insurance **pays the bill** (updating the `billing` table).

5. **Chat System for Staff**
    - A **doctor or nurse** sends a message.
    - It is **stored in the `messages` table** with timestamps.
