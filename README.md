# **CureCloud**

A centralized health management system for modernizing healthcare record-keeping and patient management.

## **Overview**

CureCloud is a cloud-based health management system designed for hospitals and clinics. It streamlines patient information storage, specialist bookings, and medical record management, eliminating the need for physical records. The goal is to provide a universal healthcare platform with potential AI-driven insights in future iterations.

## **Getting Started**

### **Running the Project Locally**

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone [Repository URL]
   cd CureCloud
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Client Directory:**

   ```sh
   cd ./client
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the Development Server:**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

This will start the frontend, and you should see the application running on `http://localhost:5173` (or the assigned port).

## **Access & Contributions**

CureCloud is an open-source project. Contributions are welcome! If you would like to contribute, please follow the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss your proposed updates.

## **Deployment**

For testing deployment locally, you can use Firebase Emulator:

1. **Install Firebase CLI (if not installed):**

   ```sh
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```

2. **Start the Firebase Emulator:**
   ```sh
   firebase emulators:start
   ```

This will simulate how the app will function when deployed.
